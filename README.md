Gray Area’s Creative Code Immersive is a ten-week education program focused on giving a small cohort of students a strong foundation in the art of creative code. Each week, our resident instructors guide participants through a sequence of topics that are designed to both lead to mastery of core techniques and strengthen students’ professional practice in the field of art and technology.

## Schedule

Each week focuses on a new creative creative code technique with 10 hours of
instruction distributed over three sessions, **Tuesdays & Thursdays (6pm – 9pm)** & **Saturdays (12pm – 4pm)**.
